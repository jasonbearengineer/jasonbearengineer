- Hi, I'm Jason Bear.
- I'm interested in eltronics and 3D printing.
- I'm currently learning electronic physics and microelectronics.
- I'm originally from Upstate New York.
- I'm a Senior in Electrical Engineering.
- I chose my major because I have always been fascinated by electronic and wanted to know how they work.
- A fun fact about me is i like to play video games and read fantasy book.
- What do I want to learn from EE 205?: I want to further my programming skills as I currently have only the most basic skills.
- A book I would recommend is The Man with the Golden Torc by Simon R. Green.
